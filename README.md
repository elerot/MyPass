# MyPass
Password, crypto,


It is just a application that for myself actualy, but i decided to publish in google play and source in github to improve it

Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elerot.mypass2

About applicaiton;
  You just sign in with a key for encryption on login(actualy it is not literely login) and then it encypts the your password localy.
  It means that you can change your key on every login to encrypt your data and your key is not storing anywhere.
  It just storing your encrypted passwords.
  
  No code qualty matter :) or can be improve.
  
 NOTE: it uses AES
